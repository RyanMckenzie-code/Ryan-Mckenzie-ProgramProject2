Hello So this is my Project
The closed tuna fish cans are the good items
use the arrow keys to move
the open tuna cans are the bad items
keep in mind the enemies on the second page do spawn in random locations and they do not do damage
once you collect the 9 tuna cans a portal will open up for the second map and you must find it
if you collect an open tuna can it will end the game
this is a very basic prototype so because of random spawns the tuna cans might overlap I did not really have time to fix it
I did use AI in some of the difficult and tedious portions of my code which explains some of the unclear variables and ran out of time to fix but I tried to organize my code in a clean manner
I also tried to do some cool collision stuff with walls in the map, did my own research for this implementation
